    "K-means did a good job of identifying three clusters that mostly agree with the three classses. \n",

    "However, looking at the finer details, k-means wasn't able to fully capture the inherent coherence of the two linearly shaped classes (purple and green). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to notice is that the clusters are partitioned in a way that doesn't capture the density of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red dashed lines in the scatter plots indicate the boundaries between the \"voronoi\" regions that separate the clusters.\n",
    "It's not clear why the two purple points on the lower portion of the yellow cluster were mislabelled. \n",
    "Similarly, the green points between the two green and purple clusters were mislabeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the silhoutte score is higher for the clustering result than it it for the actual class labels. This is appropriate though since the actual classes slightly overlap, as is also indicated by the negative values in the silhoutte plot for the pink and red classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and explore some different approaches. Of course, in real world clustering problems, you don't have the benefit of knowing the answer like we did in this experiment, so you will need to be creative.The K-means algorithm performed reasonably well in identifying three clusters that mostly align with the true class labels. However, a closer examination reveals that K-means struggles to accurately capture the elongated, linear structure of the two classes (represented in purple and green).\n",
    "\n",
    "One notable limitation is that K-means does not effectively account for the density distribution of points. The resulting clusters are separated by \"Voronoi\" boundaries (indicated by the red dashed lines), which split the space into regions that are equidistant to the nearest centroids. This approach inherently assumes spherical shapes for clusters and can misclassify points if the true distribution deviates from this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the two purple points within the lower section of the yellow cluster were misclassified. Similarly, some green points situated between the main green and purple clusters were also labeled incorrectly. This highlights K-means' inability to fully respect the density-based continuity of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more flexible clustering approach, such as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), might be more suitable for this type of data. DBSCAN takes density into account and can identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes, potentially capturing the true structure of the data more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world clustering tasks, the ground truth is not known, so exploring multiple algorithms and adapting them to the specific data characteristics is essential. Testing different methods like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering, which consider density and proximity in non-linear ways, could provide better results for complex datasets.\n"
