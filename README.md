# ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning with Python â€“ IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and code developed as part of the **Machine Learning with Python** course, which is a component of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) on Coursera.

## ðŸ§  Course Overview

The course offers a comprehensive introduction to machine learning using Python. It covers both supervised and unsupervised learning, including topics such as regression, classification, clustering, and model evaluation. The course emphasizes practical applications and provides hands-on experience with real-world datasets using popular Python libraries.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - SciPy
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

You can explore each notebook by launching them in a Jupyter environment. Each notebook walks through specific machine learning concepts with examples and exercises. The notebooks are designed to be self-contained and beginner-friendly.
